This repository is the final project for the EPP Class in Winter 22/23. It is a
replication of my own research project for the Econometrics Research Module at the
University of Bonn. While the original project was done in Stata, the ideas have been
transferred here in a reproducible fashion in order to fulfill the requirements of the
EPP Class.

## Usage

To get started, create and activate the environment with

```console
$ conda/mamba env create
$ conda activate gambling_metrics
```

To build the project, type

```console
$ pytask
```

## Credits

This project was created with [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)
and the
[econ-project-templates](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/econ-project-templates).
